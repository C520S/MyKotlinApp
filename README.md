# MyKotlinApp
I made a mobile application that generates automatic restaurants. It contains three pages which are login page, home page, and favourites page. The technologies I used are, Kotlin, Firebase auth, Rest API, and Firestore.
Each user can log in and add their favourite restaurants to the list
You can use these two users for testing
frank@qq.com     pw: 123456   with own data
uu@qq.com         pw: 123456    with empty data
